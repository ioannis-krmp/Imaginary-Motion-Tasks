# Imaginary-Motion-Tasks

Subjects will take part in a four-session experiment that will comprise two real motion tasks and two hypothetical motion tasks. Each activity lasts around 6.5 minutes and includes 80 trials (4 conditions balanced based on the stimuli shown). During 3.5 seconds, visual stimuli are shown, followed by a 1.5-second fixation cross. Each stimulus shows an image of two footsteps in the center of the screen on a black background, with the right, left, right and left, or no footfall highlighted, resulting in four indication circumstances. Auditory stimuli are delivered every 5 seconds for 1 second, and a fixation cross is shown during the test. In our case we have only hypothetical motion tasks. Unfortunately, I cannot upload the data due to lab policy.
